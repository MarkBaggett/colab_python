The command \"crack_password\" is comprised of smaller commands such as reading files containing hashes and guessing password.  \n","\n","Just like the English language is comprised of smaller components, your English teacher can teach you lots of things about writing in English.

I can teach you word definitions and sentence structure but it is up to you to write the next great literary work or even a modest grocery list. In the end your programs will **require you to research** how to accomplish small goals and accumulate those small goals to accomplish a larger goal.\n","\n","You will have to \"think backwards\" into a solution. You will be learning how to do small things in Python. Things like, how to convert numbers into character or split strings, but problems aren't given to you like this. They are given as big general statements.  \"Read the file and find all the hackers.\" We have to do the same thing we did with the poem. \"I know these words rhyme how can I put them together to make a poem.\" becomes \"I know this function reads files and this keyword searches for strings, how can I put them together\"\n","\n","When you don't have any idea what commands to use, you have to break the big tasks into smaller ones.

What are the inputs and outputs? What possible values can crash your program? Always think about the first piece of data and the last piece of data and how they might be handled differently.  Those are called your \"edge cases\".\n","\n"," - Develop a Plan: Once you understand the problem, plan out how you'll solve it. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Then break those sub-problems into smaller pieces. Repeat that process until you get to a function or module that exists in Python that does that thing. If you get to the smallest component and you don't know a thing that does that you must either break it down again or expand your knowledge of available commands in Python. Think about what functions or modules you'll need to create and how they'll interact with each other.\n","\n"," - Design your solution: Create a high-level design of your solution, including the major components, the flow of data between them, and any necessary data structures. This can be a flowchart, a diagram, or even pseudo-code.  Using \"program stubs\" is useful here.\n","\n"," - Write your code: Once you have a plan and design in place, start writing your code. Start with the main function or module, and gradually work your way down to the smaller, more granular functions.\n","\n"," - Test your code: As you write your code, test it frequently. Make sure each function is working as expected, and that the overall program is achieving the desired results.\n","\n"," - Debug your code: If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, use debugging tools to identify the problem and fix it.\n","\n"," - Refine your code: Once your code is working correctly, look for ways to optimize or improve it. Consider factors like speed, efficiency, and readability.\n","\n"," - Document your code: Finally, make sure to document your code thoroughly. Add comments explaining what each function does, how it works, and why it's necessary. This will make it easier for others (or your future self) to understand and modify your code."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### Designing a solution\n","\n","When designing your solution we often \"stub out code\" using the keyword pass. We just write the names of functions that will perform major tasks then fill in those details later.
